* Genotype time series
It isn't uncommon to create a timeseries for categorical data for which an
analysis of a continuous variable is performed for each category. An example is
visualizing the proportion of all sales a category of food comprises, over time.

| Category | Sales   | Proportion of all sales | Quarter | Delta |
|----------+---------+-------------------------+---------+-------|
| Organic  | $300.00 |                    0.09 |       1 | -0.13 |

One row is sufficient to example the sort of data that would be visualized in
this way.

Genotypes can also be visualized this way.

I will continue from where I've left off, which is loading in some data and
playing with the functions that I was learning about for this purpose.

** TODO retain the same sample of combs for every generation, and do the thing for every generation

** Thoughts
A quantitative trait with genetic redundancy, where multiple loci can contribute
to the trait value and a trait value optimum exists, has a very large number of
arrangements. An example quantitative trait, with tri-allelic values (¬±ùõâ or ùüé),
and twenty redundant loci has an extremely large number of genetic arrangements
for reaching the trait optimum depending on the value of ùõâ.

To observe if non-local load causes a population to change in its average
genetic structure over time, the gene pool of the population can be sampled by
ùêç‚Çëùê¢ùõâ, where ùê¢ is the number of redundant loci, and ùõâ is the absolute
selection-coefficient of a non-zero allele.

For a quantitative trait with:
ùêç‚Çë = 10,000
ùê¢ = 20
ùõâ = ‚Öô

The size of the sample of the gene pool is ~33333. We don't need to calculate
the population-scaled fitness for every genotype or take an arbitrary sample
size, but can use this number to take an appropriate sample size to find the
statistically relevant genotypes rather quickly.

For a single population, we can reduce that number by half as well.

#+begin_src R
  p1sampled <- p1nc %>% mutate(combs = list(sample(.$comb[[1]], 16666)))
#+end_src

The next step in this analysis, now that we have an appropriate sample of the
gene pool, is to calculate the population-scaled fitness of these genotypes and
find the top two quartiles, to see if the population is meaningfully changing on
a large scale. If we don't see anything, we can look at the bottom two quartiles
to see if a smaller component of the population is changing. That would be interesting.
