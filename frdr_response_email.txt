0. Data set name
Raw and analyzed data from: The Interaction Between Local Adaptation and Conditionally Deleterious Mutations

Is it possible to rename the dataset to: "Raw and analyzed data for: The accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutational load is augmented in regions linked to adaptive loci - 2022 - BioRXiv"? Do you have suggestions for this? I would appreciate it.

1. File name
`APCD10Cr_mutations_db_created-20211228.db` would be an appropriate name, I think.

2. GitHub Repo

3. README

4. Description

5. Authors
I have spoken with my professor/supervisor/principal investigator, and I am the sole author of the data and code, so it is okay that Jon Mee remains as "datacite.contributor.Supervisor" in the metadata.

Sam Yeaman is the other principal investigator in the research, but I am the sole data author. Sam's last name was included in some of the filenames because when I named them I was thinking about the future paper, and unsure what else to call them. The files have been renamed.

6. Related publications
The manuscript is still being written, so we have not published it to bioRXiv or with a journal yet. I asked my professor, Jon Mee (jmee@mtroyal.ca), about this and he said the title I can use in the dataset and metadata is: "Mee, J.A., Carson, B.A., & Yeaman, S.M. (2022) The accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutational load is augmented in regions linked to adaptive loci. BioRXiv manuscript in preparation".

I do not know if you want to include the last clause in the related publications metadata, but as the manuscript is still being written and not on BioRXiv yet, it may be appropriate. When the manuscript is published to BioRXiv, then users would be able to find it there, _if_ they check (as I think metadata is not updated after publication of the dataset).

However, my GitHub will be updated to include the name of the publication and its location and ciation information as it becomes available.
